Scripts to generate data required for i18n-formats

For Grapheme Break Rules, the following files are required to be placed in the data folder:
https://ssl.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/tags/release-50-1-2/source/data/brkitr/char.txt
http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/auxiliary/GraphemeBreakProperty.txt

I have refrained from including the files here to avoid breaking copyright/licenses.
